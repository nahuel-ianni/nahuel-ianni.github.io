# Personal portfolio
My personal website, built with semantic `HTML`, `CSS` and minor `JavaScript` functionality.  
It implements an adaptive layout for different resolutions and devices, as well as full capabilities on devices with `JavaScript` disabled.

You can see a live version of the website [here](https://nahuel-ianni.github.io/).
